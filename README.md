This visual studio solution has a completed command line application, project 'CarAppIOC', which manually implements inversion of control dependency management.

The solution also has an empty project 'MyCarWithContainer'. Your job is to implement the same application with an IOC container.
You may create your own container or use an IOC container provided by a dependency injection framework like Autofac, Ninject, or other.
You may also create an external JSON/XML configuration file and Microsoft configuration extensions to configure your container.

Please comment your code with explanations of your design choices and contrast with other possible other choices. 

Thank you for your time.
